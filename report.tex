\section{Software Architecture Description}

This section provides a description of the software architecture of your application. your application is made up of a collection of Java classes; explain why you identified \textit{these classes} as being the right ones for your application. Identify class hierarchical relationships between classes: which classes are subclasses of others?\\[1]

In this section I will provide a description of the overall software architecture of my application. I will explain why I identified the Java classes I've chosen as being the right ones for my implementation of the Stateless and Stateful drones. The UML Diagram in this section will show the hierarchical relationships between the classes and show which classes inherit from others. 

\subsection{UML Diagram}
\label{UML Diagram}
\begin{description}
\item[Stoichiometry]
The relationship between the relative quantities of substances taking part in a reaction or forming a compound, typically a ratio of whole integers.
\item[Atomic mass]
The mass of an atom of a chemical element expressed in atomic mass units. It is approximately equivalent to the number of protons and neutrons in the atom (the mass number) or to the average number allowing for the relative abundances of different isotopes. 
\end{description} 

\subsection{Reasoning}
\label{Reasoning}
\begin{description}
\item[Stoichiometry]
The relationship between the relative quantities of substances taking part in a reaction or forming a compound, typically a ratio of whole integers.
\item[Atomic mass]
The mass of an atom of a chemical element expressed in atomic mass units. It is approximately equivalent to the number of protons and neutrons in the atom (the mass number) or to the average number allowing for the relative abundances of different isotopes.
